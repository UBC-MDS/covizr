`covizr` is a R package that provides easy access to Covid-19 data from
[Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus), as well as
functions to generate relevant Covid-19 charts and summaries easily. We
aim to make `covizr` simple and easy to use. Our goal is to enable
anyone with basic R programming knowledge to access and visualize
Covid-19 data, and make their own informed decisions and conclusions.

There are existing R packages that allow users to download and generate
Covid-19 charts. For example,
[covid19](https://github.com/covid19datahub/COVID19/) is a package that
presents worldwide COVID-19 data from several sources in a R
environment.

We aim to provide simple visualization functions that allow users to
answer questions regarding the Covid-19 pandemic as quickly as possible.

## Features

This package contains four functions: `plot_metric`, `plot_spec`, `get_data` and `plot_summary`.

* `plot_metric`: Create a line chart presenting COVID total new cases verses another metric within a time period

* `plot_spec`: Create a line chart presenting specific country/countries COVID information within a time period

* `get_data`: User can retrieve the COVID data from the source as a dataframe. Specific data can be retrieved by passing the date range and the list of countries

* `plot_summary`: Create a horizontal bar chart summarising a specified variable and value within a time period


## Installation

``` r
devtools::install_github("UBC-MDS/covizr")
```

After installation, we recommend to restart the R session before proceeding, as there may be dependencies packages being updated.

## Usage and Examples

To use the package, import the package with following commands:

```r
library(covizr)
```

To use the functions, see below examples:

### Retrieve COVID-19 data with specified date range and default all locations

```r
df = get_data(date_from="2022-01-01", date_to="2022-01-21")
```

### Plot summary graph (bar chart)

```r
plot_summary(df, var="location", val="new_cases", fun="sum", date_from="2022-01-01", date_to="2022-01-15", top_n=10)
```

### Plot COVID-19 cases for specific countries (line chart)

```r
plot_spec(df, location=c("Canada", "Turkey"), val="new_cases", date_from="2022-01-01", date_to="2022-01-07")
```

### Plot new COVID-19 cases versus another metric (line chart)

```r
plot_metric(df, loc_val = c("Canada"), metric='positive_rate', date_from="2022-01-15", date_to="2022-01-21")
```
